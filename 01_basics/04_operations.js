// There are different types of operations like 
// 1. Negative of a string

let value = 2
let negValue = -value
console.log(negValue)

//Similarly console.log(2+-*/2), these all operations are also done. also power 2**2 and remainder 2%2...!

let str1 = "Hello"
let str2 = " World"

// Adding strings
let str3 = str1 + str2
console.log(str3)

//Now if adding string with number 
console.log("1" + 2); //12
console.log(1 + "2") //12
console.log("1" + "2") //12
console.log("1" + 2 + 2) //122.  agr string first me he toh pura string
console.log(1 + 2 + "2") //32. agr string baad me he toh pehle wale unke normal wale me krlo phir string ki tarah add

console.log("+true") //since we know simple true will give output as true only but after using "+" this will convert into numerical form and return as 1 similarly for false it will give 0
